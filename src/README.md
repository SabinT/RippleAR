# Studio: Image Targets

This project demonstrates how to use Image Targets to anchor virtual content to images in the real world.
There are multiple spaces in this project that showcase different types of image targets.
Update the entry space (Settings -> Project Settings -> Entry Space) to test them all.

Learn more about developing Image Target experiences in our [documentation.](https://www.8thwall.com/docs/studio/guides/xr/image-targets/)

### Space: Default (Flat)

The original Image Target images can be found in the assets folder: `assets/cards/targets`.
